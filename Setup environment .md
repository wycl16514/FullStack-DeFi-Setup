In this section we will setup the framework for the development of DeFi Application. We will use Node.Js, ReactJS, and Solidity in the process of development. And we will use HardHat to
help for testing and deploying smart contract.

First we need to install Nodejs from https://nodejs.org/, After completing the installation, run the following command in console:

```js
node --version
```
If you get version number as feedback then you are ok for nodejs. Then create a new folder name FullStackDeFiApps, and go in there to run the following command for generating skeleton
for reactjs application:
```js
npx create-react-app my-defi-apps
```
It will go for a while until its complete, then we cd to the folder my-defi-apps, and run:

```js
npm run
```
Then you will bring up a web page with the react logo spinning. You can save all files after the project creation for backup since running this command would take a while, and when you
want to create new project, then you can the backup without wasting your time for wating the running of the command. Then in the same directory we will install Hardhat by running 
command:

```js
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```
After installing, we need to remove the README.md which is generated by create-react-app:

```js
rm README.md
```

Then run:
```js
npx hardhat
```
Then Select "Create a Javascript project", which you can just click return:

Then it will ask to set the hardhat project root, which we can click return, the following steps will just click return would be ok. Then open vscode and drag the project folder into
it, and open hardhat.config.js for editing:

put the code like following:
```js
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  paths: {
    sources: "./src/backend/contracts",
    artifacts: "./src/backend/artifacts",
    cache: "./src/backend/cache",
    tests: "./src/backend/test"
  }
};
```
The sources field tell hardhat where to find the source files of solidity, the artifacts point to the directory where hardhat can put the result of compiling sources of solidity,
cache used to save internal files for hardhat, and tests will save test cases specially for smart contract, then we need to create folder at places showed in the paths field:
```js
mkdir -p src/backend/contracts
mkdir -p src/backend/artifacts
mkdir -p src/backend/cache    
mkdir -p src/backend/test
```
Then remove the folder of "contracts" and "test" at the project root which are created by Hardhat. Now we are ready to deploy smart contract. Now we can think about how to compiling
and deploying smart contract in local environment, of course all these will rely on hardhat.
